Finding Community

In the summer of 2012, I set out for a walk from my home in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, with no particular destination in mind. There was no traffic on Clarkson Avenue when I set out that evening at 10 p.m. A few cabs scurried here and there but, for the most part, all was quiet. There was, however, this fleeting sense that something ominous needed to be unearthed, exposed, and addressed. I was beginning to take a deeper look at my community at that time, because I was fed up with the lack of cohesion on so many levels within it (and in others like it). A lack of cohesion in the sense that community members and actors in the community needed to realize that their individual plights are tied together, because without that understanding, community members cannot act together to become the agents of change needed to maintain and move their communities forward. As I journeyed, I thought about trying to determine the factors that could really change the trajectory of people's lives and our overall quality of life right there in the inner city of Brooklyn. 

The walk brought me through many neighborhoods, starting in East Flatbush to Crown Heights via Utica Avenue; to Prospect Heights via Eastern Parkway; to Park Slope via Union Street; through Boerum Hill to Downtown Brooklyn across Atlantic Avenue; on to Brooklyn Heights via Henry Street; through Cadman Plaza Park (just kissing DUMBO) over the Brooklyn Bridge; to the Civic Center in lower Manhattan; through the Financial District to Battery Park City; through Tribeca; to the West Village and on to Chelsea; through Midtown; along the Upper West Side to Harlem West; and ending in Washington Heights. At the start of what would become an eight-hour long journey, I didn't know what I was looking for. However, 16.5 miles later at 147th Street in Washington Heights, a very simple idea dawned on me, "My community lacks certain inputs that others have in abundance."This idea spurred me into action. I could not help but think about the reasons why communities like mine lacked inputs, as well as how my community could become more cohesive in order to address its deficits. It was from this continual thinking, that the idea of (Community Forward) CommFWD was birthed. Check back in soon as we grow and see what develops as a result of this endeavor.
